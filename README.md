# Push_swap

## Overview
`push_swap` is a sorting algorithm challenge where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using the smallest number of operations. It involves two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a limited set of commands to manipulate them.

---

## Objectives
- Write a sorting program in C.
- Optimize for minimal operations.
- Understand algorithmic complexity and efficiency.

---

## Features
- **Two Stacks:** Operate on `a` and `b`.
- **Commands:**
  - **Swap:** `sa`, `sb`, `ss`
  - **Push:** `pa`, `pb`
  - **Rotate:** `ra`, `rb`, `rr`
  - **Reverse Rotate:** `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`
- **Sorting Goal:** Sort integers in ascending order in stack `a`.

---

## Requirements
- **Language:** C
- **Standards:** Adherence to the Norm.
- **Memory Management:** No memory leaks or segmentation faults.
- **Makefile:** Targets include `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, and `bonus`.
